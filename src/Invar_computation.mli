(** Helpers for sorting formulas into invariants, and other types of formulas *)

(** 
   Static_prop: a proposition that does not include any variable relation
   nor any temporal operator.
   Primed_prop: a propostion that may include variabale and constant
   relations, without any temporal operator except un-nested X (next) or
   prime.
   Invar: proposition of the form always (phi) where phi does not include
   any temporal operator (the color pf phi is Init or Static_prop).
   Init: proposition without any temporal operator.
   Trans: proposition of the form always (phi) where the color of phi is
   Primed_prop.
   Temporal: any other proposition.
